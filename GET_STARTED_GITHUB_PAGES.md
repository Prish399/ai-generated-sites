## 🎯 3 Simple Steps To Get Started

### Step 1: Create GitHub Token (5 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Click**: "Generate new token" → "Tokens (classic)"
3. **Fill in**:
   - **Note**: `WebGenie Deployment Token`
   - **Expiration**: `90 days`
   - **Scope**: Check ONLY `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. **Click**: "Generate token" button
5. **COPY** the token immediately (you won't see it again!)
   - Token looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**⚠️ Security**: Don't share this token with anyone!

---

### Step 2: Add Token to Your Project (2 minutes)

1. **Open** your project file: `.env.local`
   - Location: `c:\Users\91977\Desktop\ai\web_genie_fin\.env.local`

2. **Find** the section that says:
   ```bash
   # GitHub Deployment Configuration
   GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE
   GITHUB_USERNAME=Prish399
   ```

3. **Replace** `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   GITHUB_USERNAME=Prish399
   ```

4. **Save** the file

5. **Restart** your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (2 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/Prish399/ai-generated-sites/settings/pages

2. **Under "Source"**, select:
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`

3. **Click**: "Save"

4. **Wait** a few seconds, then you should see:
   > "Your site is published at: https://prish399.github.io/ai-generated-sites/"

✅ **Done!** GitHub Pages is now enabled!

---

## ✅ Test Your Setup (5 minutes)

Once you've completed all 3 steps above, test that everything works:

1. **Start your app**: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

2. **Generate a website**: 
   - Enter a prompt (e.g., "A landing page for a pizza restaurant")
   - Wait for the AI to generate the code

3. **Click Deploy**:
   - You'll see a green "Deploy" button in the preview panel
   - Click it
   - You should see "Deploying..." spinner

4. **Wait for success**:
   - After 2-5 seconds, you should see a message in the chat
   - A green "Live ↗" badge should appear
   - The message will show two URLs

5. **Visit your live website**:
   - Click the "Live ↗" link OR
   - Go to: https://prish399.github.io/ai-generated-sites/
   - You should see your generated website live! 🎉

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Error: "GITHUB_TOKEN not configured"

**What to do**:
1. Check that `.env.local` has `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...`
2. Make sure your token is NOT empty
3. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
4. Try clicking Deploy again

### ❌ Error: "Repository not found"

**What to do**:
1. Make sure your GitHub token has `repo` permission
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click on your token
   - Check that `repo` is checked
2. If not, regenerate the token with `repo` permission
3. Update `.env.local` with new token
4. Restart dev server

### ❌ Website not showing at GitHub Pages URL

**What to do**:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes (GitHub Pages takes time to build)
2. Hard refresh your browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
3. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Prish399/ai-generated-sites/settings/pages
   - Verify it says "Branch: main"
4. Check the recent commits in GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Prish399/ai-generated-sites
   - You should see recent commits from your deployments

### ❌ Old version showing instead of new

**What to do**:
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages rebuild
3. Try in an incognito/private window
4. Check latest commits to see if code was actually pushed

## 🎯 What's Next?

1. **Follow the 3 steps** above (15 minutes total)
2. **Test deployment** with a sample website (5 minutes)
3. **Start generating** your own websites and deploying them!

Each time you generate a website:
- Click "Deploy" button
- Code goes to GitHub
- Website deploys to: https://prish399.github.io/ai-generated-sites/
- Share the URL with others!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Share your deployed sites**: Give people the GitHub Pages URL to view your generated websites

2. **Version control**: All your generated code is saved in GitHub, so you can go back to any previous version

3. **Iterate quickly**: 
   - Generate → Deploy → Get feedback → Regenerate → Deploy again
   - All old versions are saved in git history

4. **Custom domain** (Advanced):
   - In GitHub Pages settings, you can add a custom domain
   - Point your domain to GitHub Pages
   - Your site can have any URL you want
